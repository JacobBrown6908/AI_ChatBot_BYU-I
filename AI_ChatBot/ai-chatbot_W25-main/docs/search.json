    "text": "Weekly Work\nThis week, we focused on developing our front end and integrating it with the back end. Additionally, we began building the Admin page and connecting a MongoDB database to the model. This allows us to track what students are asking, and we hope teachers can use this analysis to improve their teaching on a daily or weekly basis.\nWe have also started implementing a scroll feature, enabling users to review past prompts and responses from the model. Furthermore, we’re working on adding customization options to the front end, such as dark mode and theme selection, to enhance the user experience."

    "text": "Weekly Work\nThis week, we started by dividing the work among us, focusing on four key areas: RAGs, frontend development, API login, and database storage for prompts.\nTyler, J.T., and Jacob are working on the RAGs, with Tyler leading this section since he has already made significant progress in this area.\nJake is leading the frontend development, collaborating with Brandon and Scott. Scott is focusing specifically on the frontend UI, while Brandon is working on database creation alongside Jena. Meanwhile, Jake is also handling API login, working closely with Eduardo.\nOur goal is to spend the next week gaining a deeper understanding of each component before bringing everything together. We aim to integrate the pieces into a functional system within the next week or two, followed by testing and fine-tuning to ensure everything runs smoothly."

    "section": "",
    "text": "At the end of last week, we had the opportunity to present our research and work to Brother Ashby, the Head of AI Usage at BYU-Idaho. He informed us that our initial work was a strong foundation for developing a new Tutor/T.A. Chatbot for the campus.\nWe were advised to focus on general data privacy rather than exclusively on FERPA laws, with FERPA falling under that broader umbrella. Additionally, we were encouraged to realign our presentation with the mission statement of BYU-Idaho:\n\nBrigham Young University-Idaho was founded and is supported and guided by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Its mission is to develop disciples of Jesus Christ who are leaders in their homes, the Church, and their communities.\nProviding a high-quality education that prepares students of diverse interests and abilities for lifelong learning and employment.\nServing as many students as possible within resource constraints.\nDelivering education that is affordable for students and the Church.\n\nOver the weekend and before our Thursday meeting, we worked on revising this section of our presentation, adjusting the focus of our PowerPoint and executive summary accordingly. We also spent time understanding Vertex AI and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) data storage and retrieval. This is a key part of the next phase of our project—developing a Vertex AI system integrated with RAG data related to the course."

TJ and Jenaveve have worked on finding FERPA laws and concerns about using AI in the school. Jake has been working on the front end with API keys and has made significant progress in building a platform to send and receive text. He is also working on adding different tools for teachers and students. Tyler is reaching out to different department heads and trying to set up meetings. Brandon is working on the executive summary, making it look polished and keeping things organized as one of the project managers. Jacob had a meeting with a member of the CSE department at BYU-Idaho, Brother Barney, and received valuable guidance on how to build prompts for the different models we want to use in testing."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Weekly Work\nThis week, we have been working on integrating RAGs with multiple courses into a single AI tutor bot for students. Several ideas have been discussed.\nInitially, we considered having one tutor bot per course that any student could access. However, this approach posed challenges, as courses change each semester, making integration with Canvas, the school’s online education system, more complex.\nNext, we explored the idea of creating a corpus of all course materials, categorized into different RAGs and storage buckets. Under this approach, each student would have a personalized corpus based on the courses they are enrolled in. This corpus would update at the beginning of each semester, ensuring the AI tutor contains only relevant information for that student’s active courses.\nAdditionally, we plan to implement a function that updates students’ corpora after the drop/add deadline. This would automatically adjust their AI tutor to reflect any newly added or dropped courses.\nBy structuring the system this way, we believe RAGs wouldn’t need to run multiple times for each student, but rather just once per semester—provided that buckets (data storage locations) are updated by instructors. This approach maintains high-quality interactions while ensuring the AI tutor remains helpful to both students and faculty."

    "text": "Weekly Work\nWeek one, we started to work on doing research on which model would be best to use. We were given some direction on where we should spend our time, and we are currently looking at Gemini Gems, Chat GPT, BotPress, and Google AI Studios. All of them pose different problems and, more importantly, different solutions.\nGemini Gems: This program is very new, and because it’s so new, some of the problems might change, but we think we should address them anyway.\nCons:\n-You cannot share keys, making it almost impossible to create a bot that will benefit the whole school with a model that\n-needs to be accessed by a number of students per class.\n-It is hard to share files with this program, making it hard for students to submit assignments to have a mock grade.\nPros:\n-It is new, and we hope that we can start making some major changes.\nChat GPT: Chat GPT is an AI that is being used by countless students, so it would not be hard to build a model from this pre-existing GUI.\nCons:\n-Chat has a very limited amount of tokens, about 4,000 every few hours, only allowing for a few queries.\n-You are not able to share the paid-for version with others, so each student would need to pay for their own.\nPros:\n-Chat is one of the largest AIs out in the world, and because of this, it has a large backing of pre-built knowledge.\n-It has an easy-to-use prompt builder with easy-to-teach/train parameters.\nBotPress: This AI is new and a third party, with more limited backing and trained knowledge.\nCons:\n-The responses are very vague and not the best for student understanding.\n-Does not seem easy to use with an API, and overall, it’s the team’s least favorite.\nGoogle AI Studios: This is a little older and is designed to make your own AI, with both free and paid versions.\nCons:\n-We would say it’s too intuitive, making it tedious to give it specific blocks on what not to train it on.\nPros:\n-Over 1,000,000 tokens a minute for free.\n-Easy to upload files and receive feedback.\nAll of these options have potential to be used in different areas of education, and we are starting to see that we might have to work with all of them. However, we also want to try and narrow it down to one or maybe two, to limit our task of building an AI tutor for the campus here at BYUI."
