### Weekly Work

This week, we are working on making our executive summary. Edwardo and Scott are looking for price points for each of our models that we are considering. TJ and Jenaveve have worked on finding FERPA laws and concerns about using AI in the school. Jake has been working on the front end with API keys and has made significant progress in building a platform to send and receive text. He is also working on adding different tools for teachers and students. Tyler is reaching out to different department heads and trying to set up meetings. Brandon is working on the executive summary, making it look polished and keeping things organized as one of the project managers. Jacob had a meeting with a member of the CSE department at BYU-Idaho, Brother Barney, and received valuable guidance on how to build prompts for the different models we want to use in testing.
