### Weekly Work

This week, Jake presented his work with Vetex AI, showcasing the front-end development he’s been working on to build out the model for the class. So far, he has designed the front end, incorporating the school's logo and adding interactive side tabs for users. He’s been putting in a lot of effort to make the interface both engaging and functional, ensuring it serves as a helpful tool for both students and teachers.

We also had Tyler present his work on RAGs, where he demonstrated a bot running directly from his terminal. His project looks polished and well-structured. The setup is straightforward, thanks to Google Cloud's step-by-step documentation on RAG code, which simplifies the process for anyone looking to replicate his work.
