### Weekly Work

This week, we are finalizing our executive summary and working on building our PowerPoint presentation. We are hoping to present this to heads of departments over the next week to work on building models for simple classes that might help them enhance learning and serve as a reliable resource for their students.

We have finished most of the front-end development, with a large part of the work credited to Jake Zalesny, as he is our developer. We are also mainly done with our FERPA research—shout out to JT Twiggs and Jenaveve White, who have been working hard to keep us compliant with these laws.

Scott Townsend and Eduardo Ramirez have been working on a cost analysis, specifically focusing on start-up costs and potential savings for the school. We have also been working on outreach, with Tyler Binning taking the lead in communicating with department heads and faculty to help set up meetings and build relationships.

Lastly, Jacob Brown and Brandon Ansbergs have been leading this project in our meetings and within our chats. We’ve been working on cleaning up the summary and building the PowerPoint.
