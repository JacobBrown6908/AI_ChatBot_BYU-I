### Weekly Work

This week, we have decided that we will most likely stick with Google AI Studios. Some members of the team are working on building our front end so that we can integrate it with Canvas, our school's class management platform. We are also exploring the pricing for the 3-4 different AI programs we plan to use. The goal is to present this information to the school and hopefully secure approval to move forward with building this system. Additionally, we began working on creating an executive summary to help structure our PowerPoint presentation. We aim to begin presenting to the heads of colleges and department chairs within the next two weeks.
