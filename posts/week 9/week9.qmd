### Weekly Work

This week, we focused on developing our front end and integrating it with the back end. Additionally, we began building the Admin page and connecting a MongoDB database to the model. This allows us to track what students are asking, and we hope teachers can use this analysis to improve their teaching on a daily or weekly basis.

We have also started implementing a scroll feature, enabling users to review past prompts and responses from the model. Furthermore, weâ€™re working on adding customization options to the front end, such as dark mode and theme selection, to enhance the user experience.
