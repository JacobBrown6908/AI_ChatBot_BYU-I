At the end of last week, we had the opportunity to present our research and work to Brother Ashby, the Head of AI Usage at BYU-Idaho. He informed us that our initial work was a strong foundation for developing a new Tutor/T.A. Chatbot for the campus.

We were advised to focus on general data privacy rather than exclusively on FERPA laws, with FERPA falling under that broader umbrella. Additionally, we were encouraged to realign our presentation with the mission statement of BYU-Idaho:

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <em>Brigham Young University-Idaho was founded and is supported and guided by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Its mission is to develop disciples of Jesus Christ who are leaders in their homes, the Church, and their communities.</em>


Providing a high-quality education that prepares students of diverse interests and abilities for lifelong learning and employment. 

Serving as many students as possible within resource constraints.  

Delivering education that is affordable for students and the Church.

Over the weekend and before our Thursday meeting, we worked on revising this section of our presentation, adjusting the focus of our PowerPoint and executive summary accordingly. We also spent time understanding Vertex AI and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) data storage and retrieval. This is a key part of the next phase of our projectâ€”developing a Vertex AI system integrated with RAG data related to the course.
